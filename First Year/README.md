# First Year Projects

These are the projects I had when I was in first year college. Some of these works are in collaboration with my other classmates.

### Computer Programming 1 Sample Codes

Most of these are Java codes which explore the basics of the programming langauge. It mostly tackles the syntax, data structures and their corresponding methods, and other Java utilities.

### GoSafety App

It is a simple HTML and CSS website for my Human-Computer Interaction course. It was a mockup for an app proposal of our group. The app is a companion app in the context of COVID-19, where the user could plan their trip, see if there are restrictions in their destination, and warn them of local outbreaks. The project does not have any major logic behind it beside connecting the other pages.
