# School Coding Projects
Throughout my academic journey, I've actively engaged in various coding projects, progressively enhancing my technical skills and gaining valuable insights into the real-world applications of programming. These projects have enabled me to explore diverse domains, ranging from web development and data analysis to machine learning and mobile application development.

## First Year
**Introduction to Programming (CS2602)**
In my first year, I embarked on my programming journey through the course Introduction to Programming (CS2602). This course provided a solid foundation in programming fundamentals, including variables, data types, operators, control flow statements, and functions.

**Human-Computer Interaction (CS26012)**
The course Human-Computer Interaction (CS26012) introduced me to the principles of designing user-friendly interfaces and interactive systems. I learned about user-centered design methodologies, usability testing, and the importance of creating intuitive and accessible interfaces for diverse users.

Project 1: Designing a User Interface for a Web App
As part of this course, I designed a user interface for a web application, considering factors such as screen layout, navigation, and iconography. I applied the principles of visual hierarchy and user-centered design to create an interface that was both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.

## Second Year
**Information Management (CS2608)**
Delving into the realm of data management, I took the course Information Management (CS2608). This course provided a comprehensive overview of database concepts, including data modeling, normalization, and query languages.

Project 2: Creating a Database for a Order Management System
To apply the learned concepts, I created a database for a order management system using MySQL. This project involved designing tables, establishing relationships between tables, and implementing queries to retrieve, update, and manage order information.

**Web Development (CS2609)**
The course Web Development (CS2609) opened up the world of web technologies, introducing me to front-end and back-end development concepts. I learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side programming languages, gaining hands-on experience in building web applications.

Project 3: Developing a Dynamic Website with User Authentication
To showcase my web development skills, I developed a dynamic website with user authentication features. This project involved creating user accounts, managing login sessions, and implementing data validation and error handling.

## Third Year
**Machine Learning (CS ELEC 2C)**
Venturing into the field of artificial intelligence, I enrolled in the course Machine Learning (CS ELEC 2C). This course delved into the principles of machine learning algorithms, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Project 4: Predicting Fake News Using Machine Learning
To apply machine learning techniques, I trained a machine learning model to predict if a specific news article is fake based on various factors such as title, content, and keywords. This project involved data cleaning, data exploration, feature selection, and model selection.

**Mobile Development (CS26011)**
Expanding my skillset into mobile application development, I took the course Mobile Development (CS26011). This course introduced me to the fundamentals of Android app development, including Java programming, Android Studio, and the Android SDK.

**Operating Systems (CS26014)**
The course Operating Systems (CS26014) provided me with a deep understanding of the inner workings of computer systems. I learned about process scheduling, memory management, file systems, and operating system security.

Project 6: Implementing a Disk and CPU Scheduling System

This project involves implementing disk and CPU scheduling algorithms to optimize the performance of a computer system. Disk scheduling algorithms are responsible for ordering disk requests to minimize the average seek time, while CPU scheduling algorithms determine the order in which processes are executed to maximize throughput and minimize turnaround time.
